# StrikeSmart: CV-powered Boxing Punch Classificaton

## Overview
Boxing is a relatively simple sport. Fighters utilize a set of merely 6 punches: hook, cross, right/left jab, and right/left hook. Automatic classification of a fighter's punches from match footage has high use potential for boxers: being able to quantitatively understand one's own tendencies or the tendencies of a future opponent can be invaluable, and automating this process streamlines tactical preparation. This project aims to create a machine learning model capable of taking in YOLOv8-detected keypoints on match footage and predicting whether or not sequences of frames contain punches.
